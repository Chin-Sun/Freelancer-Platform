# Freelancer-Platform
Freelancer is a brand-new type of employment that links 
service providers with those who need their services. This 
platform aims to close the employment gap between skilled 
laborers and those who want their services by offering a 
scalable solution. The platform must include several essential 
elements to accomplish its purpose, including user 
authentication using OAuth protocols, a front-end application 
interface, skills profiling for service providers, and service 
request profiles for end users. The system must accommodate a 
sizable user base and offer unique dashboards for each user. 
Also, based on both profiles, the system needs to be able to 
suggest the best service provider and give information on user 
activities. This platform also can support a large number 
of users at the same time with its customized dashboard. Based on 
each clientâ€™s profile, the most matched projects are suggested to 
the freelancer or business. In this project, we propose a web-based 
freelancer platform that exploits all of these features to provide a 
solution to connect service providers and service demanders more 
comfortably.

This web application is implemented by Django and HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end.
